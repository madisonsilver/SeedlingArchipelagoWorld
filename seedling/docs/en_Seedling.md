# Seedling

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which would normally be acquired throughout the game have been moved around! Progression logic remains, so the
game is always completable. However, because of the item shuffle, the player may need to access certain areas
before they would in the vanilla game.

## What items and locations get shuffled?

All upgrades, keys, totem shards, and seals are shuffled.
If "Boss Locations" is enabled, boss kills are also locations, and corresponding Seals are added to the pool.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed in another player's world.

## What does another world's item look like in Seedling?

Upgrades, keys, totem shards, or chests.  If Boss Locations are enabled, killing a boss will also send out an item.
